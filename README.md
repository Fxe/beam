# Grins

A free and open source Java library for parsing and generating [Simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_molecular-input_line-entry_system) line notations. The primary focus of the library is to provide an implementation of the [OpenSMILES](http://www.opensmiles.org) specification for the [Chemistry Development Kit (CDK)](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cdk/). The code is separate to avoid cluttering the CDK API with data structures specific to Grins.

## Goals
 - Handle tetrahedral and double bond stereo chemistry and maintain configuration through different orderings
 - Canonization via a permutation of vertices in the chemical graph
 - Unification of double bond stereo using atom-based configuration - ['@' for Cis/Trans around Double Bonds
](http://www.opensmiles.org/opensmiles.html#_tt_tt_for_cis_trans_around_double_bonds)

## Planned 
 - Generation of Universal SMILES ([Oâ€™Boyle, 2012](http://www.jcheminf.com/content/4/1/22))
 - Allene, Square Planar, Trigongal Bipyramidal and Octahedral topologies
